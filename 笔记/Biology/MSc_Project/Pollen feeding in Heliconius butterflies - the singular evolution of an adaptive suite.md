# Abstract

Major evolutionary transitions can be triggered by behavioural novelty, and are often associated with ***'adaptive suites'***, which involve shifts in multiple co-adapted traits subject to complex interactions. Heliconius butterflies represent one such example, actively feeding on pollen, a behaviour unique among butterflies. **Pollen feeding** permits a prolonged reproductive lifespan, and co-occurs with a constellation of behavioural, neuroanatomical, life history, morphological and physiological traits that are absent in closely related, non-pollen-feeding genera. As a highly tractable system, supported by considerable ecological and genomic data, Heliconius are an excellent model for investigating how behavioural innovation can trigger a cascade of adaptive shifts in multiple diverse, but interrelated, traits. Here, we synthesize current knowledge of pollen feeding in Heliconius, and explore potential interactions between associated, putatively adaptive, traits. Currently, no physiological, morphological or molecular innovation has been explicitly linked to the origin of pollen feeding, and several hypothesized links between different aspects of Heliconius biology remain poorly tested. However, resolving these uncertainties will contribute to our understanding of how behavioural innovations evolve and subsequently alter the evolutionary trajectories of diverse traits impacting resource acquisition, life history, senescence and cognition.

主要的进化转变可以由行为新颖性触发，并且通常与 “适应套件” 相关，其中涉及多个共同适应特征的转变受到复杂的相互作用。Heliconius 蝴蝶代表了这样一个例子，主动以花粉为食，这是蝴蝶中特有的行为。花粉摄食允许延长生殖寿命，并与一系列行为、神经解剖、生活史、形态和生理特征共同发生，这些特征在密切相关的非花粉摄食属中不存在。作为一个高度可追踪的系统，在相当多的生态和基因组数据的支持下，Heliconius 是一个极好的模型，用于研究行为创新如何触发多个多样化但相互关联的性状的一系列适应性转变。在此，我们综合了目前对 Heliconius 花粉取食的认识，并探索了相关的、推测适应性的性状之间的潜在相互作用。目前，还没有生理、形态或分子创新与花粉取食的起源明确联系，Heliconius 生物学不同方面之间的几个假设联系仍然没有得到很好的检验。然而，解决这些不确定性将有助于我们理解行为创新是如何进化的，随后改变影响资源获取、生活史、衰老和认知的不同特征的进化轨迹。

在这儿，Heliconius主动吸食花粉的行为被认为是一种新的特征，它触发了一系列适应性的共同适应特征，例如身体结构或行为的变化，这使得蝴蝶能够有效地吸食花粉。这些特征可能是随着蝴蝶环境或行为的变化而进化出来的，也可能是使蝴蝶在其特定栖息地取得成功的一系列特征的一部分。

# Introduction

+ Heliconius gather pollen by probing flowers and collecting it as a lumped mass on the proboscis. The pollen load is mixed with saliva (/səˈlaɪvə/ 唾液) and **externally digested** to release **amino acids** that are drawn up the proboscis
+ supply of aa prolonged reproductive **lifespan**
+ co-occurs with behavioural, neuroanatomical, life history, physiological and morphological **changes** (not occurs in closely related, non-pollen-feeding Heliconiini)
+ pollen-rich sources suggests that they may have the capacity for spatial navigation, probably using learnt visual landmark
+ pollen feeding **evolved relatively recently** and the suite of traits associated with pollen feeding is widely assumed to have evolved **only once**


# An energetic payload

+ nutrient intake changes of Lepidoptera between the larval - adult stages 
	+ larvae are generally herbivorous (食草的);
	+ adults of most species feed **nectar** (花蜜)
		+ nectar is carbohydrate-rich, but protein-poor (aa poor)
+ Heliconius **females** generally collect **more pollen** than males:
	+ add amino acids into eggs
+ Heliconius have dramatically extended lifespans
	+ around six months in the wild
	+ but four to six weeks in Dryas iulia (a non-pollen-feeding Heliconiini)
	+ relationship between pollen feeding and longevity is not well quantified


# Origins of a novel trait

## (a) Reconstructing evolutionary shifts in pollen feeding
+ species of the ‘Neruda’ clade is not feed on pollen and as  the only non-pollen feeding Heliconius
	+ may offer the possibility of decoupling pollen feeding and its associated adaptations
+ unclear, two possibilities:
	+ pollen feeding evolved once in Heliconius and was secondarily lost in the Neruda;
	+ or evolved multiple times within Heliconius, with Neruda retaining the ancestral state 
	+ ~~with these two scenarios being equally parsimonious?~~
+ broadly, the scarcity of pollen feeding across the approximately 180,000 described species of Lepidoptera marks Heliconius as particularly peculiar.

## (b) Fitness during evolutionary transitions: effects of adult amino acid intake
+ pollen feeding may have originated with the incidental intake of amino acids while nectar feeding (presence of aa in nectar, often derived from contaminating pollen grains)
	+ increase sensitivity to aa
+ benefits derived from amino acids in the adult diet vary widely between Lepidopteran species
	+ In several species, **no association** has been found between **fecundity** (繁殖力)
	+ but for some species, it has been **linked to increases in egg quantity and size**
		+ male Coenonympha pamphilus produced larvae with larger hatching masses
	+ **fruit-derived aa** may similarly facilitate an extended lifespan

But puzzle is that why pollen feeding so rare??   
Identifying the adaptations necessary for the transition to pollen feeding

## (c) Using old traits for new purposes 
+ pollen collection does **not involve** any novel morphological structures 
	+ However, Heliconius do have longer and more numerous bristles
	+ Intrinsic muscles involved in coiling movements are more numerous and extend further into the proboscis 
+ pollen processing may be derived from proboscis grooming behaviours

Saliva plays a key role in pollen feeding
+ salivary glands of Heliconius are larger
+ greater quantities of saliva 
+ higher proteolytic activity of the saliva (and more higher in females)

Like all butterflies, Heliconius lack cocoons
+ _cocoonase_ homologues may have been co-opted for use in digesting pollen proteins 
+ However, a functional role for cocoonase in pollen feeding has not yet been directly demonstrated

### Unclear
How proteolysis would break down sporopollenin, the primary component of pollen exines, as it is not composed of proteins

Pollen grains are damaged after processing by Heliconius However, how is this achieved? 
+ solely by mechanical digestion,
+ or through biochemicals capable of breaking down sporopollenin, as is claimed for Gelechiidae moths


# Increases in behavioural sophistication and neural elaboration

## (a) Exploitation of a novel resource: plant–animal interactions and foraging strategies
Heliconius collect pollen predominantly from cucurbitaceous vines:
+ Relatively rare, but pollen rich _Psiguria_ and _Gurania_ (show co-evolution)
	+ Heliconius are the primary pollinators (传粉昆虫) of Psiguria
	+ visiting more plants, depositing more pollen, greater distance than hummingbirds
+ Several species of Gurania and Psiguria appear to have evolved lower nectar production and smaller flowers to attract Heliconius 

Heliconius established ‘traplines’:
+ Heliconius possess a capacity for navigation using learnt visual landmarks 
	+ Heliconius traplines centre on a limited home range of 100m<sup>2</sup> to 1km<sup>2</sup>, within which individuals return to the same roosting (栖息) locations at night
+ Heliconius seem peculiar in maintaining long-term, stable home ranges with high **roost-site fidelity** (恋地性)
+ Site fidelity is presumably a pre-requisite (先决条件) for trap lining

Variation in the exploitation (开采/利用) of pollen sources:
+ Species of the *melpomene* clade tend to forage more intensively on Psiguria,
+ *Erato* clade species predominantly exploit non-cucurbitaceous plants, such as *Lantana* 

Two possibilities:
+ pollen feeding arose in the context of coevolution with certain cucurbitaceous vines, with members of the _erato_ clade subsequently pushed towards other pollen resources owing to competitive exclusion.
+ originated as a more opportunistic, generalist strategy, retained in the erato clade, with specialization on Cucurbitaceae secondarily emerging in the melpomene group.

## (b) Neural basis of a cognitive adaptation
Heliconius have dramatically enlarged mushroom bodies (3 - 4 times larger than normal Lepidoptera), the demands of trapline foraging is hypothesized to have driven mushroom body expansion 

Indirect evidence:
+ comparative data from *Hymenoptera* (膜翅目，如蜜蜂), mushroom bodies coincided with the evolution of parasitoidism (拟寄生现象), which relies on spatial memory for host location
+ plasticity experiments in a desert ant showed visually guided foraging experience affects mushroom body maturation

Increases in Heliconius mushroom body size have also been speculatively linked to host plant use.

The impacts of pollen feeding in _Heliconius_ clearly extend beyond direct effects on fecundity, shaping their foraging strategy and probably changing the types and complexity of information processed and stored by the brain.

# Ripple/knock-on effects (连锁反应) following evolutionary innovations

In Heliconius, the evolution of pollen feeding has been linked to an extensive suite of life history, reproductive and phenotypic traits. Highlight three areas in which pollen feeding is hypothesized to have altered Heliconius biology:
1. Alter how energetically expensive investments are provisioned during the larval stage
2. Increase cyanogenesis (氰化作用)
3. Decrease in adult mortality owing to predation, together with a delay of reproductive senescence, probably strengthened selection for extended lifespans

# Disentangling the origins of a singular adaptation

Five fundamental questions that can be addressed through further investigation of pollen feeding in Heliconius.
1. **How quickly** do behavioural innovations alter selection on related traits?
	+ several traits comparing with non-pollen feeding relatives;
	+ evolved in a short time or gradually through time? 
2. What **molecular mechanisms** underlie functional innovations?
	+ the mechanisms that Heliconius saliva can break down pollen remain unclear;
3. How do **biological trade-offs** shape the evolution of novel traits?
	+ Novel traits often involve considerable costs
4. What **selective pressures** and constraints shape brain evolution?
	+ In Heliconius, increased behavioural sophistication putatively co-occurs with an expansion of the mushroom bodies.
5. What mechanisms permit **delayed reproductive senescence** and **extended lifespans**?
	+ Uncovering the mechanisms by which _Heliconius_ delay senescence, and the potential role of pollen-derived amino acids, could provide valuable insight into ageing processes.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we highlight pollen feeding in Heliconius as a remarkable example of a behavioural innovation triggering an adaptive shift across a suite of multiple, interrelated traits, with the potential to become a highly informative, textbook case of the causes and consequences of behavioural evolution. By exploring the questions set out above, we can make progress towards better understanding how behavioural novelties arise, and subsequently lead to profound changes across diverse aspects of an animal's biology.  

总之，我们强调，Heliconius 的花粉喂养是一个显著的例子，行为创新触发了一系列相互关联的特征的适应性转变，有可能成为一个信息丰富的教科书案例，说明行为进化的原因和后果。通过探索上述问题，我们可以在更好地理解行为新奇是如何产生的方面取得进展，并随后导致动物生物学的各个方面发生深刻变化。


# From another paper 


Curiously, a contraction in the Hemocyanin superfamily was only observed in H. aoede, the only Heliconius species not to feed on pollen in our data, marking hexamerins as a potential mechanistic link to the divergent strategies for nitrogen storage in pollen-feeding Heliconius.

![[../../assets/contraction of Hemocyanin SF.png]]

Some of their main findings include:
-   A robust phylogeny that resolves some previously uncertain relationships within Heliconiini
-   A series of bursts in evolutionary rate at the base of the radiation
-   Evidence for multiple introgression events within major clades of Heliconiini
-   Variation in genome size driven by transposable elements (TEs) and large segmental deletions
-   Expansion and contraction of gene families related to key innovations such as pollen feeding, chemical defence and colour pattern formation
-   Positive selection on genes involved in host plant adaptation, detoxification, vision and wing development
-   Differential gene expression patterns associated with pollen feeding behaviour

The paper provides a comprehensive resource for studying the genomic basis of adaptive traits and speciation in an enigmatic group of insects.
