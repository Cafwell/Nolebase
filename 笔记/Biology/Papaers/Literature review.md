Butterflies are a type of lepidopteran insect characterized by their scales covered body and wings, as well as their long beak-like mouth that is adapted for drinking nectar and other liquids. Normally, butterfly species forage for nectar, and some adults feed on sap, juice of rotten fruit, animal excreta and other substances, which is the behaviour known as Mud-puddling. Typically, the flower emits a scent that is attractive to butterflies and when they feed on nectar, pollen stained in some parts of the body can be used for effective pollination.

Although most butterflies only feed on nectar, some species such as Heliconius and Laparus of the Nymphalidae have evolved to consume pollen and benefit from pollen-derived amino acids. One issue is that butterflies can only intake liquid due to the unique structure of their mouthparts, which means Heliconius and Laparus must devise a pollen management strategy. The solution is to consume pollen with a liquid of unknown origin. According to anatomical evidence, the liquid is either released saliva or regurgitated nectar. Experiments show that pollen-feeding butterflies do not use regurgitated nectar for pollen processing. Their approach is to stick pollen at the base of their mouths by using stiff hairs, and then secreting saliva to flush the pollen back and forth for several hours. Eventually the pollen grains are destroyed and the butterfly can inhale the dissolved substance into the pollen. Feeding on AA-rich pollen can boost egg production and allow for a longer life span than non-pollen-feeding species, which are up to six months.

Heliconius' pollen feeding evolution has influenced the evolution of their pollen sources, plants in the Cucurbitaceae family such as Gurania and Psiguria. Heliconius butterflies in this family have evolved to specialise on pollen sources, and the plants have responded by increasing the complexity and diversity of their floral traits. As a result, there has been a coevolutionary arms race between butterfly and plant species, with each responding to the evolutionary changes of the other. Heliconius butterflies, for example, have longer and more numerous bristles, and several species of Gurania and Psiguria appear to have evolved lower nectar production and smaller flowers to attract Heliconius butterflies.

In conclusion, the study of butterflies, particularly the Heliconius species, provides fascinating insights into the evolution of feeding behaviour and the interaction of plant and insect species. According to a recent research, the Hemocyanin superfamily, a diverse group of oxygen carrying proteins with highly conserved structural and functional characteristics across different taxa, may be a potential gene evolution influence, with a contraction observed in the only Heliconius species that does not feed on pollen. These findings emphasise the complex relationships that exist between insect and plant species, as well as the importance of further research in this area.
