# 1 Antibodies
## 1.1 B cells
+ From **bone** marrow, stem cells.
+ About a billion B cells are produced every day during a person's lifetime.
+ Can produce Antibodies

## 1.2 Immunoglobulin (Ig)
IG differs from AB in that IG is a chemical structure and AB is a biological function. **All AB's are IG, but not all IG's have antibody activity.**

Antibody (Ab) is an Ig produced by B cells that proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells after **antigen** stimulation.

Type of Ig:
+ Secretory IG (SIG) : Secreted into bodily fluids, mediates the humoral immune response;
+ Membrane IG (mIg) : constitutes the antigen receptor on the B cell Membrane. (BCR)

## 1.3 Structure
![[../../assets/Antibody structure.jpg|600]]
### Variable region
Also known as **Ag-binding sites***, binding to vast variety of antigens. Many forms.

### Constant region
+ 4-5 forms.
+ Determines form of interaction with immune cells to dispose antigen.

### Fab and Fc
+ Full name: Fragment antigen-binding/Fragment *crystallizable* region
+ Fab is the part **on the top of** Hinge, Fc is on the bottom.
+ **Enzyme papain** can be used to cleave it into two Fab and an Fc fragment.
+ Hinge gives flexibility

### Chain
+ 2 Heavy chain (Inside) 450 – 550aa
+ 2 Light chain (Outside) 211 – 217aa

## 1.4 Classes
The heavy chain (has a variable domain) determines the immunoglobulin class:
+ **IgG**: makes up about 75% of all antibodies in the blood
+ **IgA**: ***most abundant*** that protects the mucosal surface. *Abs in breast milk protect infants*
+ **IgE**: anti-parasitic infection
+ **IgM**: 5 IgG; Activating complement system
+ **IgD**
They are differ in size, Charge, Amino acid composition and Carbohydrate content.

### [Diversity?](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/301078477)
Antigen recognition then leads to diversification
+ Somatic hypermutation
+ Gene conversion
+ Class switching or class switching recombination

## 1.5 Functions
![[../../assets/Functions of Abs.png|650]]
In opsonization, the pathogens are marked prior to being destroyed while in neutralization, the effect of the pathogen is neutralized.

# 2 Complements
## 2.1 Complement system
### 2.1.1 Complement
Consist of  many proteins (Mostly enzymes). The proteins of the complement system are called complement components.

 Named as C1 - C9:
 
+ C1 is made up of **three** subunits, named C1q, C1r, and C1s
+ A segment produced by the cleavage of a complement, denoted by a lowercase letter suffix. Usually, large fragments are specified as "b" and small fragments as "a". 
+ But for historical reasons, for the C2 fragment, the **larger fragment is named C2a**, and the smaller one is designated C2B. 

### 2.2.2 Function
It is part of the innate immune system. Finally, A hole-like *Membrane attack complex (MAC)* is formed on the target microorganism, which causes the microorganism to rupture and die.

MAC: Can be produced by 3 complement pathways. Be composed of C5b-6-7-8 complex and C9 polymer. Loss of cellular homeostasis

## 2.2 Activation
Classic pathway:
+ Activation through antibodies
+ Alternative pathway
+ Mannose-binding **Lectin pathway**

### 2.2.1 Classic pathway
C1 is binding to classical pathway Activating factors (mainly antigen-antibody complexes containing IGM, IGG1, IGG2 or Igg3) for activation
+ Recognition stage
+ Activation stage
+ Membrane attack stage

### 2.2.2 Lectin pathway
Activated by Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) & Ficolin when they bind to structure of sugars on the surface of pathogenic microorganisms

### 2.2.3 Alternative pathway
Certain bacteria, fungi or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Endotoxin) , yeast polysaccharides, dextran, agglomerated IgA and IgG4 are activators
+ C3 is hydrolysed into C3a, C3b, C3B and binds to B, D, and P factor
+ Since the creation of C3b, the three pathways have reacted very similarly

### 2.2.4 Anaphylactic shock
+ When a large number of antibody-antigen complex can not be eliminated and precipitate, it will lead to tissue damage at the precipitate site, resulting in **type III hypersensitivity**
+ Immune complex activated complement system molecules (C3a, C5a)
+ C3a and C5a initiate inflammatory response due to they can act as **chemoattractant**. So they are also know as **anaphylatoxin**
+ Act on specific receptors of endothelial and mast cells
+ Degranulation and increased local vascular permeability

When produced in large amounts: induce generalized circulatory collapse = anaphylactic shock.
