# Clinical research
## Phases of clinical research
*Preclinical*   
Testing of drug in non-human subjects, to gather **efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetic** information.  
Dose: Unrestricted

*Phase 0*
**Pharmacokinetics**; particularly, oral bioavailability and half-life of the drug.  
Dose: very small, subtherapeutic

*Phase I*
Determines whether drug is safe to check for **efficacy**. Testing of drug on healthy volunteers (20-100) for dose-ranging.
Dose: often subtherapeutic, but with ascending doses   
Success rate: ca. 70%

*Phase II*
determines whether drug can **have any efficacy**; at this point, the drug is not presumed to have any therapeutic effect whatsoever. Testing of drug on patients (100-300) to assess efficacy and side effects.
Dose: Therapeutic  
Success rate: ca. 33%

*Phase III*
Determines a drug's **therapeutic effect**; at this point, the drug is presumed to have some effect. Testing of drug on patients (300-3000 patients with specific diseases) to assess efficacy, effectiveness and safety
Dose: Therapeutic  
Success rate: 25%-30%

*Phase IV*
Watch drug's **long-term effects**. Postmarketing surveillance – watching drug use in public
Dose: Therapeutic

# Animals in clinical research
## 1 Animal models - Invertebrates
+ Fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster
	+ easy to grow
	+ various visible congenital traits
	+ polytene (giant) chromosome
  
+ Roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans
	+ small size/genome
	+ translucent body
	+ defined development patterns
	+ rapidly assayed for abnormalities

### Drosophila melanogaster and immune research
*No adaptive immune system*

Can be genetically modified in numerous ways  
77% of human disease genes have homologs in D. melanogaster  

### Caenorhabditis elegans and immune research
*No cell-mediated immunity*

Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2002: Sydney Brenner use them as model for over 40 years and found programmed cell death.

Solely rely on antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme, antibacterial factors
65% of human disease genes have homologs in C. elegans

**Main disadvantages**: rudimentary (基本的) immune system. Evolutionary distance to humans

## 2 Animal models - Vertebrates
+ Mouse  *Mus musculus*
+ Rat  *Rattus norvegicus*
+ Zebrafish  *Danio rerio*

### Mice

### The [zebrafish](https://www.zebrafishfilm.org)
#### Merits
+ Short generation time (3 months)
+ Large clutch sizes (100s of eggs)
+ External fertilisation
+ Easy and cheap husbandry; microinjections of eggs easily accessible and cheap
+ Transparent embryos
+ Rapid development
+ In vivo observations possible
+ Tool kit well developed
+ 84% of human disease genes have homologs in D. rerio

#### Drug Discovery
First whole animal approach

Zebrafish larvae arrayed into 96-well microtitre plates → chemical library robotically dispensed into the media

#### Limitations of zebrafish as model
+ Not a mammal & lack placenta
+ Poikilothermic (an organism, such as a frog, with a variable body temperature that tends to fluctuate with and is similar to or slightly higher than the temperature of its environment)
+ Gender not genetically determined
