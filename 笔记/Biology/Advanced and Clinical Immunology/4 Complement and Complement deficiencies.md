# 1 Concepts of Opsonisation
Opsonin, from Greek: opsōneîn, which means ready to eat.

Every cell membranes have negative charge (ζ - potential), making it difficult for two cells to come close together.

Opsonin chemically modifies molecules to make microbes or apoptotic cells interact more strongly with cell surface receptor on Macrophages (MØ) or NK cells

## Opsonin molecules
+ Abs: IgG and IgA
+ Components of the complement (cx) system: C3b, C4b, iC3b and C1q
+ Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) initiates the formation of C3b

## Interaction of Ab with Ag
Useful by itself.
+ coating a virus or bacterium thus preventing it from binding to — and invading — a host cell
+ binding to a toxin molecule (e.g., diphtheria or tetanus toxin) thus keeping the toxin from entering a cell

## Effector mechanism
Those processes by which pathogens are destroyed and cleared from body. 

The complement system provides the actual protection from the response   
while   
The interaction of antibodies and antigen provides the specificity of the response.

Antibodies “identify" the target, complement destroys it.


# 2 Complement
Complement interacts with diverse branches of the immune system including the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems , kinin-formation pathways, cytokine production and both B- and T-cell differentiation and activation.

## Classical:
![[../../assets/Classical pathway.png|700]]
MAC: C5b6789n

Activists (antigen antibody complexes) and C1q are combined with C1r, C1s, C4, C2, C3, and formation of C3 conversion enzyme (*C4b2a*) and C5 conversion enzyme (*C4b2a3b*) cascades.

C1 is a complex of C1q, 2 C1r and 2 C1s

## Alternate: 
![[../../assets/Alternate pathway.png]]
Factor I & H: regulate C3bB
Factor P (properdin): stabilizes C3bB
(Stabilized by [[Bio-dict#^8e500b|properdin]])*

Unlike classical pathway, the cascades start from the direct activation of C3 but pass C1, C4, and C2. C3b bind to factor B takes place in a way that allows factor D to cleave factor B. Then gives rise to the C3 convertase *C3bBb*.

## Lectin: 
![[../../assets/Lectin pathway.png|700]]
MBP/MPL: Mannan Binding Protein/Lectin
MASP: MBP associated serine protease

Homologous to the classical pathway, with the opsonin, MBP and [[Bio-dict#^0dc3df|ficolins]], instead of C1q
form the classical C3-convertase (C4b2a)


## Assembly and Regulation of the MAC
The Cx terminal pathway provide immune protection by forming MAC

Genetic deficiencies of MAC components lead to recurrent infections.  
However, unregulated MAC formation causes tissue damage.

### Hereditary Angioedema
HAE is a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling. Result of genetic mutations of the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH)
+ Type l: Impaired secretion of C1-INH 
+ Type ll: Secretion of a dysfunctional C1-INH
