# Autoimmune
## 1 Autoimmune hemolytic anaemia (AIHA)
### What is AIHA
The immune system is abnormal and produces Auto-Antibodies that attack red blood cells as foreign antigens. ^ceaa34

+ manifest as [[Bio-dict#^1fa2b1|NN anaemia]]
+ Arise as a primary condition or secondary to underlying condition
+ Secondary to Malignancy; Autoimmune disease or Inflammation

According to the optimal temperature at which the antibody acts on red blood cells is divided into warm antibody type (w-AIHA) and cold antibody type:
+ w-AIHA: optimally at 37°C, ∼70% to 80%
+ below 37°C, ∼13%

### Cause of AIHA
1. Other diseases
2. Immunodeficiency
3. Infections - CMV; EBV
4. Drugs
5. Malignancy

### Diagnosis
DAT (direct antiglobulin test) **Positive**  
{Depending on the presence of incomplete antibodies on the surface of red blood cells in some patients, agglutination may occur after the addition of antiglobulin serum.}

DAT test was not specific for AIHA!

Indirect antiglobulin test **Positive**  


## 2 Autoimmune thrombocytopaenia (ATP/AIT)
### What is ATP
A disorder of low blood platelet counts in which *platelet destruction* is caused by antiplatelet autoantibodies.
+ Can be due to primary casues: Idiopathic Thrombocytopaenic Purpura (ITP)
+ Can be due to secondary causes: Autoimmune Thrombocytopaenic Purpura (ATP)

### Pathophysiology
Mainly due to IgG autoantibodies, which bind to platelets and MKs. Platelets with bound autoantibodies are subsequently recognized by phagocytes bearing Fcγ-receptors; Autoantibody binding to MKs can inhibit their maturation or can lead to their destruction

Autoreactive T cells are also involved in platelet and MK destruction

The cytokine profile of patients with ATP is also imbalanced
+ E.g.  higher serum levels of IL-2, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-17

### Treatment for AIT
1. Corticosteroid (皮质类固醇): prevent the destruction of platelets by macrophages within the spleen and liver
2. Immunoglobulins: used to desensitise the immune system
3. Splenectomy (脾切除术)

## 3 Autoimmune Neutropoenia (AIN)
Can be 1° or 2° with the later present in adulthood.
1. AIN is a rare disease, usually affects infants; self limiting
2. Arises in the context of other autoimmune disorders; In association with infections like EBV/HIV

# Alloimmune
Alloimmune vs Autoimmune   
Alloimmunity: Sometimes called isoimmunity is an immune response to nonself Ags from members of the same species

Autoimmunity: Autoimmunity is the system of immune responses of an organism against its own healthy cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an "autoimmune disease".
