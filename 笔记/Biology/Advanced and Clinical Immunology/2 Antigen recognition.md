 # Overview
 
 In order to initiate an immune response, antigen must be recognized.   
 ==Distinguish self from non-self==  

Molecules:

+ Innate immunity  
– Toll-like (TLR), CTL (C-type lectins) and NOD-like (NLR) receptors   
– Invariant TCR (NK recognition) (Rapid)   
– Non-polymorphic MHC (i.e. CD1)   
– Non-classical MHC   

+ Adaptive immunity  
– T cell Receptor ( α/β and γ/δ )   
– Immunoglobulins   
– MHC – pathogen fragment presentation   

# Innate immunity
Rely on unique molecular features of pathogens. Not adapt.

Innate immunity in plants/flies/mammals is conserved.

## 1 Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
### 1.1 PCRs
4 types:  
+ Nucleotide oligomerisation receptors (NLR)
+ Toll-like receptors (TLR)
+ C-type lectin receptors (CLR)
+ RIG-1 like receptors (RLR)

### 1.2 PAMPs
==【Exogenous danger signal】==

PRRs recognise Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)
![[../../assets/PAMPs.jpg|400]]
For Example: β-Glucan (β-葡聚糖): Essential **part of cell wall** of bacteria, fungi, algae, plants, yeast. *β-1,3-glucan* can as a Pathogen-associated molecular pattern.

As a result, β-glucan can be used in *human medicine*.
+ Promotes wound healing
+ Immunomodulators 免疫调节剂
+ Stimulates immune system
+ Vaccine adjuvants

Or used in *veterinary medicine*.
+ Increases disease resistance
+ Stabilisation of the gastro-intestinal tract
+ Improved stress resistance
+ Vaccine adjuvants

### 1.3 Danger theory
PRRs can recognise Damage-associated molecular Pattern (DAMP), They are Endogenous and Exogenous. (Highlighted)

Dead or stressed cells release molecules that can act as an adjuvant to the immune system or signal danger. ==【Endogenous danger signal】==

Damage-associated molecular Pattern (DAMP) include:
+ DNA, RNA, Heat shock proteins (HSPs), hyaluronic acid, serum amyloid A protein, ATP, uric acid and also cytokines like interferon alfa, interleukin-1β, CD40L …
+ HMGB1, DNA, RNA, S100 proteins, purine metabolites, hyaluronan fragments

## 2 Adaptive Immunity
### 2.1 Clonal selection theory
Explains the function of immune system cells (lymphocyte) in response to specific antigens that invade the body.

Lymphocyte has specialized receptors long before they come into contact with the antigen, which is then selected by the foreign antigen to activate, proliferate, and produce antibodies[.]([.](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E5%85%8B%E9%9A%86%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9))
### 2.2 Antigen recognition by lymphocytes
B cells and T cells use different ways.

#### 2.2.1 T cell
T cell receptor (TCR) is a specific receptor on the surface of T cells that recognizes antigens presented by Major histocompatibility complex (MHC), unlike B cell receptors, it **doesn't recognize the free antigen**.

##### TCR
The T cell receptor is a heterodimer consisting of two distinct subunits. 
+ (95%) composed of α subunit and β subunit - αβ T cell
+ (5%) composed of γ subunit and δ subunit - γδ T cell

T cell receptors form a T cell receptor complex with a constant *CD3(immunology)* molecule.

##### MHC
There are two major types of MHC, MHC I and MHC II
+ MHC I: Exist on the surface of *most* cells. Long chain + short chain ==(Antigen is usually endogenous)==
+ MHC II: Mostly exist on the surface of *APC*. 2 Long chains ==(Antigen is usually extracellular)==

##### Co-receptors
CD4 & CD8:  
CD4 and CD8 are now known as marker molecules for T cell sorting. CD8 is expressed on the surface of cytotoxic T cells (CTL), whereas CD4 is usually expressed on the surface of Helper T cells (Th cell).

CD8 recognise MHC I; 
CD4 bind MHC II;

#### 2.2.2 B cell
B cell antigen receptor
+  Cell surface immunoglobulin receptor or B-cell receptor (IgM and IgD)
+  Antigen contact initiates B-cell activation, clonal expansion, maturation to plasma cell
+  Antigen receptor is identical to immunoglobulin that will ultimately be produced
