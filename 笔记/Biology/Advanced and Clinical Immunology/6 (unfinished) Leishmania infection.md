# Leishmania parasites
Leishmania is a vector-borne digenetic protozoan parasite (媒介传播的复殖原生寄生虫), over 20 species.

life cycle alternates between two stages:
+ Promastigote (flagellated extra cellular stage)
+ Amastigote (intracellular stage without flagella)


# Infection and immunity
## Phase 1 Parasites entrance: silent phase
### Entrance inside host
An infected sandfly bites a vertebrate, a small number of parasites are injected into the host.

The sandfly lacerate the blood vessels causing haemorrhages and then feeds in the haemorrhagic pools so formed which is where the parasites are released.

### Extracellular survival

## Phase 2 Inflammation: Recruitment of phagocytic cells
### Mf entrance: Leishmania antigens

## Phase 3 Onset of immunity
