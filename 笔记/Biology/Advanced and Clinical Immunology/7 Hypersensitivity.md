Concepts:
Hypersensitivity = Immune response which harms the host
Anaphylaxis =  a *severe* and potentially life-threatening *allergic reaction*, also known as Type I Hypersensitivity
Allergic reaction = an immune response against a substance, to which the body has become hypersensitive
Allergen =  an antigen eliciting an allergic reaction (*IgE*-mediated reactions)

# Hypersensitivity
## Classification
Four primary types of hypersensitive reactions
+ Type I IgE Mediated  (Immediate)
+ Type II Antibody-Mediated (Cytotoxic)
+ Type III Immune Complex-Mediated
+ Type IV Delayed 
OR
into 2 Groups:
+ Immediate (Types I, II, & III) - Antibody mediated
+ Delayed (Type IV) - Cell-mediated

## Type I Immediate (Anaphylactic)
Symptoms appear shortly (mins or even secs) after exposure to Ag

Local reactions:
+ Rhinitis (known as hay fever):
+ Asthma:  occurs in lower respiratory tract
+ Food allergies:  occurs along the upper or lower GI tract

### IgE Ab
Typical response to parasitic infections.  
Specific IgE antibodies to a specific allergen are the main cause of type I hypersensitivity.  

Fc of Ig E combine to Mast cells/basophil cells can cause *sensitization*. When the antigen re-enters the body, it binds specifically to IgE that is already bound to the sensitized target cells, triggering a cellular degranulation reaction .

### Degranulation
Degranulation triggered by ionophores (Ca2+ influx) alone is not considered hypersensitivity.

Then, the release of bioactive substances can cause smooth muscle contraction, Telangiectasia, increased secretion of glands and a series of pathological changes.

### Treatment
Antihistamine for allergic rhinitis
Asthma:  Bronchodilators & corticosteriods
Epinephrine:  Treatment of systemic reactions
Hyposensitisation:  Allergy shots to build up IgG (blocking antibodies)
Recombinant anti-IgE

##  Type II Hypersensitivity (cytotoxic)
The antibody is mediated by binding to antigens on the surface of the target cell. Antigen can be the component of the cell membrane itself, or it can be an exogenous antigen or hapten adsorbed on the cell surface, which can cause cell damage through different mechanisms.

There are two ways:
+ complement mediated cytotoxicity (CMC)
+ antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)

Can cause some Autoimmune diseases like:
+ [[10 Immunological manifestation of haematological disease#^ceaa34|Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia]] (AIHA, 自身免疫性溶血性贫血)
+ Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN)
+ Transfusion Reaction
