# Vaccine
Biological products in order to prevent and control the occurrence and prevalence of infectious diseases.

A good vaccine should be:
+ Safe
+ Not cause illness itself
+ Few side effects
+ Give long lasting, appropriate protection
+ Low in cost
+ Stable with long shelf life (no special storage requirements)
+ Easy to administer
+ Inexpensive
+ Public must see more benefit than risk

## Difficulties in vaccine production/distribution
Scientific limitations:
+ Influenza
+ HIV (The retrovirus integrate into the host's chromosomes)
+ Malaria
+ Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Non-scientific reasons
+ Financial
+ Legal
+ Political

# How do vaccines work?
Innate or adaptive

## Acquire immunity
### Active
+ Inject or take a vaccine (The antigenic substance is inoculated into the body to cause the adaptive immune response)
+ Own Abs

### Passive
+ Infants: IgG from mother 3-6 months, then IgA in breastmilk
+ Ready-made Abs
Artificial passive immunity is short-term immunisation by transfer of Ab

## Types of vaccines
Traditional:
+ Dead/ inactivated
+ Live/ attenuated
+ Toxoids (toxin’s toxicity weakened, but immunogenicity maintained)
+ Pathogen-derived antigens

After the advent of recombinant DNA technology
+ Recombinant attenuated
+ Subunit
+ Peptide
+ Vectors
+ Nucleic Acid

### Killed vaccines
Cause no disease at all but need High dose because dead viruses do not replicate   
No mucosal immunity

#### Mucosal immunity
The first line of defence against an invading pathogen. The mucosal immune system is present in all areas where mucosa is present: the skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, oral cavity, genitourinary tract, nasal mucosa, and so on.

 Mainly use sIgA and IgM

### Live virus vaccines
No requirement for boosters and they can spread.
#### Pros and cons
Disadvantages:
+ Possible incomplete inactivation
+ Increased risk of allergic reactions: large amounts of antigen used
+ Should not be given to immunocompromised or pregnant patients
+ Side effects

Merits:
+ Multiply like natural organism
+ Require fewer doses and boosters
+ Long-lasting
+ Special storage

#### Yellow fever (YF)
Viral disease (flavivirus), spread by bite of infected mosquitoes

Cause: Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, headache. No direct treatment, but vaccine preventable.

An example of live attenuated vaccine: Yellow fever vaccine 17D

#### Recombinant attenuated virus

### Toxoid(类毒素) vaccines
A modified form of a toxin (toxoid) can be used as a vaccine. For example: diphtheria, tetanus, cholera

No longer toxic but still immunogenic.

### Subunit vaccines
It contains only the antigenic part of the pathogen which triggers the immune response. BUT less effective than whole agent vaccines.

+ Synthetic Vaccines: Not very effective; Great potential; None currently in use.
+ Recombinant Vaccines Better than above - some success has already been achieved.
+ Virus Vectors

#### HPV
HPV infects epidermis and mucous membranes; warts or cancers; can lead to cancer

First HPV vaccine is Gardasil®

### NA vaccines
#### DNA vaccines
Plasmid DNA genetically engineered to produce one or two specific proteins (antigens) from a
microbe under control of human promoter.

Potential problems:
+ Danger that immune cells will become sensitised to DNA and could result in auto-immune disease.
+ Foreign DNA could be incorporated into the host genome and could cause *cancer*.

#### RNA vaccines
Instructions for the production of specific proteins are sent to the ribosomes of the cell for production

For SARS-COV2:   
mRNA instructions for spike protein of COVID-19. The organelles produce spike pro that drive the immune system to attack or remember viral proteins, increasing the body's immunity to COVID-19.

## Adjuvants
A drug or other substance, that is used to increase the efficacy or potency of certain drugs. It is needed for weaker antigens.

The *mechanism* of adjuvant action is *not completely clear*:
1. May increase the surface area of antigen, easy to phagocytosis by macrophages; 
2. Prolong the stimulation of immune response;
3. Trap Ag in chemical complex, releasing them slowly;
4. To induce the inflammatory reaction of the injection site and the local lymph nodes, which is helpful to stimulate the proliferation of immune cells.

Many biological and chemical substances have been used experimentally

### Freund's adjuvant
A solution of antigen emulsified (乳化) in mineral oil and used for animal testing.

+ Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA or CFA)
	+ composed of inactivated and dried mycobacteria 
+ Freund's incomplete Adjuvant (FIA or IFA)
	+  no mycobacterial components

### Aluminium salts
Vaccine ingredients that have been used in vaccines since the 1930s. Small amounts of aluminium are added to help the body build stronger immunity against the germ in the vaccine.

Incorporated into DTP vaccine

# Herd immunity
Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease.
