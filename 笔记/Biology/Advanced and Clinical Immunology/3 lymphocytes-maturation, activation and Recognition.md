Lymphopoiesis, the production of new lymphocytes, happens in specialized lymphoid tissues-bone marrow for most B-cells and thymus for most T-cells.

**Some abbrs.**
haematopoietic stem cells (HSC)
multipotent progenitor (MPP)
common lymphoid precursor (CLP)
Early T-cell precursor (ETP)
PS:
**Pro**genitor cells 祖细胞
stem cells 干细胞

# 1 B cell
Overview:
HSC → MPP → CLP → Pro-B (Early/Late) → Pre-B → immature B → mature B

Microenvironment of the bone marrow provides signals for development of lymphoid precursor and differentiation of B cells. *Stromal* cells are important in those progresses.

## 1.1 HSC to Immature B
***HSC → MPP***
HSC firstly differentiate into Multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs), which are no-longer self-renewing stem cells.

***MPP can differentiate into oligopotent progenitor cells*** (progenitor cells that differentiate into only a few cell types), they are:
+ common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or 
+ ==common lymphoid progenitor (CLP)==
In this stage, [[Bio-dict#^c96c7f|RTK]] *FLT3* (other name: foetal liver kinase-2, *Flk2*) in MPP bind to a ligand on stromal cell. The signalling is needed. In addition, *IL-7* was secreted.

CLP are precursors to other mature blood cell types, including:
-   T-cells
-   ==B-cells==
-   Natural killer cells
A subset of CLPs is committed exclusively to the B-cell lineage, which give rise to Pro-B cells

***Pro-B to Pre-B cells***
Some factors paly important roles:
+ C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12)/Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1)
+ IL-7
+ TSLP
	+ resembles IL-7
+ Stem cell factor (SCF)
	+ a membrane-bound cytokine
	+ bind to RTK *c-Kit* (CD117) 
+ VCAM-1
	+ adhesion molecule
	+ bind to integrin VLA-4 in the Progenitor cells
	+ interact with cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs)

***Immature B → mature B***
Immature B cells Have functional IgM but no other Ig expression   
To complete development, immature B cells migrate from the bone marrow to the spleen

Transitional(T) B cells are B cells at an intermediate stage in their development between bone marrow immature cells and mature B cells in the *spleen*. There are two transitional stages for the B cells in mouse, T1 and T2
T1 → T2 → mature B cells
Self-reactive T1 B cells eliminated by apoptosis in response to strong antigenic signal (peripheral tolerance); T2 cells become resistant to antigen-induced apoptosis

T2 B cells differentiate into *follicular (FO/B-2) B cells* or *marginal zone (MZ) B cells*. Once differentiated, they are now considered mature or naïve B cells

## 1.2 B cell subsets
3 subsets
+ B-1 B cells - part of the innate immune system
+ Follicular (B-2) B cells (conventional B cells)
+ Marginal Zone B cell

## 1.3 B cell activation
Mature B cells: Complete IgM molecule on cell surface  
B cell activation: from immature B cells to plasma cells or memory B cells, which occurs in the secondary lymphoid organs (SLO)

2 Types:
+ T cell dependent (TD)
+ T cell independent (TI)

### 1.3.1 TD
Protein antigens and CD4+ helper T cells

## 1.4 Rearrangement
Each stage has different markers, gene expression patterns, and immunoglobulin H and L chain gene loci, arranged as B cells undergo V (D) J recombination as they develop;

## Role of IL-7
Stimulates the differentiation of multipotent stem cells into lymphoid progenitor cells 

IL-7 Receptors:
Two different protein chains 
+ Interleukin-7 receptor-α (CD127)  {bind to Jak1}
+ Common-γ chain receptor (CD132) {bind to Jak3}

Is necessary for γδ T cell development
